Wumpa
=====
Home-made PHP micro-framework
<br>
1) Overview
----------------------------------
Why Wumpa ?
Because it's a funny fruit from the Crash Bandicoot game univers... Yep, that's all... What did you expect more ? ^^
<br>
Wumpa is a one man project. It's a light weight PHP micro-framework providing basics tools for little projects.
It is not intended to compete with any of the framework on the market.
I started to work on this project in order to build myself a micro framework that fits exactly my way to code and my needs.
This framework follows some php standards such as PSR-0 autoloading and use some very neat tools for PHP development like [Composer](https://getcomposer.org "Composer").

2) Installation
----------------------------------
In order to get started you just need to get the sources. The easiest way to do so is to use Composer.

	$ php composer.phar create-project wumpa/wumpa

You can also download the sources from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/4nthrx/wumpa "Wumpa repo on GitHub").
